# Objectives
* Check for installation
* Install pip
* Update pip

# Check Installation
There are two options for the command line input, depending on the version of the Python it is linked to, if at all.
``` bash
pip --version
```

``` bash
pip3 --version
```

If you get `pip: command not found` for either, then pip is not installed. If you get a pip version #, then it is connected that respective Python version (either 3 or 2).
